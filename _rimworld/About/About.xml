 - Added way to alter stack sizes for individual items! and/or 
    ban entire categories from OgreStack altering their stacklimit
  - Overrides.xml 
    - Silver (25000) // currency
    - Jade (15000)   // stack as high as default gold
    - Beer (500)     // default stack limits make it hard to brew lots of beer
    - Wort (2000)    // stack as high as default hops
    
    // these take up too much valuable stockpile space 
    // waiting around for a trader that can buy them
